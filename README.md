Implementation of sharded time series storage built on pycassa for Apache Cassandra.

 - http://rubyscale.com/blog/2011/03/06/basic-time-series-with-cassandra/
 - http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/advanced-time-series-with-cassandra

 etc.

DISCLAIMER

Simple implementation of a few ideas around time series storage on Apache Cassandra. Many improvements
can be made and few optimizations have been made so far. We hope to improve it.

Run the tests to assert functionality.
